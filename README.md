# Portfolio-Website

This is my first web design project, created as a personal portfolio and CV. The website, along with the portfolio, is designed with the future in mind. The information about myself has been slightly embellished, and the portfolio features projects completed as part of my coursework, which still require significant improvement. I developed this site with the intention of having a solid foundation and template for real, exciting projects that I can showcase here in the future :)
